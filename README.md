# LocalFeatureExtraction4CBIR
A review for current popular local feature extraction approach in BoW-based image retrieval

## About
For content based image retrieval, current popular approaches rely on deep learning.
However, the Bow-base approach is also useful in image retrieval related applications, such as place recognition.
As a PhD student, I have wasted much time on the feature extraction step and catched many bugs.
Therefore, I want to high-light the local feature extraction in the Githhub repository.
