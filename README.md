# LocalFeatureExtraction4CBIR

## About
For content based image retrieval, current popular approaches rely on deep learning.
However, the Bow-base approach is also useful in image retrieval related applications, such as place recognition.
As a PhD student, I have wasted much time on the feature extraction step and catched many bugs.
Therefore, I want to high-light the local feature extraction in the Githhub repository.
This introdcution is orginazed by the software or public code provided by different research groups in this field. 

### VGG
code: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/affine/detectors.html#binaries
This software consists of two steps, the keypoints detectors and SIFT feature extraction. The first step provides more opitions for key-point detection, such as the low threshold of cornerness.
